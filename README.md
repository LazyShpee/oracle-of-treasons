# Oracle of Treasons

## What even is this ?

Oracle of Treasons is a Minecraft 1.16.1 Mod, developped with the [Fabric API](https://fabricmc.net/)

## No, what does it add to Minecraft ?

* An Oracle, which can trade mystery cookies and imbue them with magic.
* New Cookies with new surprises effects.

## How did you even had this idea ?

With great development power comes great stupidity.
We're doing a new "creative jam" every week and this (27/07/2020 - 02/08/2020) week we choose to make a MC Mod.

## Can I contribute/fork/steal some parts ?

We're under MIT License, so yeah, open source baby.
We would prefer knowing that you want to work on our mod before doing any kind of pull request, we're available on the Official Fabric Discord (Bidoof#0399 & LazyShpee#0042)

## Is the title a reference to Zelda, do you know treason doesn't take an s at the end ?

Yes and yes, we're french so we have to suck at english.

## Can you port this to Forge ?

__No.__

## Thanks to this guy tho, he's the boss
